## ⚠️ **DATABASE CONNECTION ISSUE**

The only issue is with the database connection due to MariaDB authentication plugin.

### 🔍 **Issue Details**
- **Error**: `Server requests authentication using unknown plugin auth_gssapi_client`
- **Cause**: MariaDB server using GSSAPI authentication instead of standard MySQL authentication
- **Impact**: API endpoints that require database access will return errors
- **Frontend Impact**: Application loads and functions, but data won't persist

### 🛠️ **Quick Fixes**

#### Option 1: Fix MariaDB Authentication (Recommended)
```sql
-- Connect to MariaDB as admin and run:
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'Qwe.123*';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

#### Option 2: Update Connection String
Add this to your `.env` file:
```env
DB_SSL=false
DB_AUTH_PLUGIN=mysql_native_password
```

#### Option 3: Use Different Database
- Install MySQL Server instead of MariaDB
- Or use a cloud database service (AWS RDS, PlanetScale, etc.)

### 📊 **Database Setup**
Once the connection is fixed, run:
```bash
# Setup database schema
npm run db:setup

# Test the connection
node fix-database.js

# Restart the server
npm start
```
